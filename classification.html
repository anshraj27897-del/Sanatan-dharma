  <h1>Classification in Sanātan Dharma</h1>

  <p>
    Sanātan Dharma, often referred to as the eternal way of life, is one of the oldest living traditions in the world. 
    Unlike many other religions, it does not have a single founder or a fixed dogma. Instead, it evolved over thousands of years, 
    absorbing diverse spiritual insights, social frameworks, and cultural practices.  
    An important feature of Sanātan Dharma is its system of <b>classification</b>, which organizes human society, life, and spirituality 
    into structured paths. This classification was never meant to suppress but to guide people toward duty (Dharma), prosperity (Artha), 
    desire (Kāma), and liberation (Moksha).
  </p>

  <h2>The Four Varṇas (Social Classification)</h2>
  <p>
    The most well-known classification in Sanātan Dharma is the <b>Varna system</b>. The word “Varna” means “color” or “category.” 
    This system divided society into four major groups, each with its responsibilities and qualities. It is important to understand 
    that originally, Varna was based more on <i>qualities and duties (guna and karma)</i> than on birth.
  </p>

  <h3>1. The Brahmins (The Intellectual and Spiritual Class)</h3>
  <p>
    The Brahmins were teachers, priests, and scholars. Their primary duty was to preserve and transmit sacred knowledge.  
    They performed rituals, taught the Vedas, guided kings, and ensured that dharma was maintained.  
    The qualities expected of Brahmins included purity, self-control, knowledge, simplicity, and devotion to God.  
    In history, sages like Vyasa (compiler of the Mahabharata), Shankaracharya, and Chanakya came from this group.  
    The Brahmins symbolized wisdom and spiritual guidance for society.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Kshatriyas (The Protectors and Rulers)</h3>
  <p>
    The Kshatriyas were warriors, rulers, and administrators. Their role was to protect the kingdom, uphold justice, 
    and defend dharma. They were expected to be brave, disciplined, and generous.  
    Examples include Lord Rama, Arjuna, and Maharana Pratap.  
    They were not only fighters but also protectors of culture and dharma.  
    A true Kshatriya combined physical strength with moral integrity.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Vaishyas (The Producers and Traders)</h3>
  <p>
    The Vaishyas formed the economic backbone of society. They were farmers, merchants, and traders.  
    Their role was to generate wealth, ensure trade, and support society financially.  
    Ancient India’s prosperity—its flourishing agriculture, trade routes like the Silk Road, and guild-based businesses—
    was largely due to Vaishya communities.  
    A dharmic Vaishya was expected to be honest, charitable, and socially responsible.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Shudras (The Service Providers)</h3>
  <p>
    The Shudras were artisans, craftsmen, and service providers.  
    Their duty was to serve and support the other three classes, but this does not mean they were inferior.  
    In fact, they were crucial for the smooth functioning of society.  
    Skilled workers, carpenters, potters, blacksmiths, and laborers came under this category.  
    A Shudra’s work was practical and essential, contributing to the economy and culture.
  </p>

  <h2>The Four Āśramas (Stages of Life)</h2>
  <p>
    Apart from social classification, Sanātan Dharma also divides human life into four stages, called Āśramas.  
    This classification ensures a balanced life, where spiritual progress goes hand in hand with worldly duties.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Brahmacharya (Student Life)</h3>
  <p>
    This stage is dedicated to education and discipline. A Brahmachari (student) lives with the teacher (Guru), 
    studies scriptures, and practices celibacy, self-control, and humility.  
    The goal is to prepare for responsible adulthood with a strong moral foundation.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Grihastha (Householder Life)</h3>
  <p>
    In this stage, a person marries, raises a family, and contributes to society.  
    Duties include earning wealth, practicing charity, protecting family, and supporting social order.  
    The Grihastha stage is considered the backbone of society, because it generates resources that sustain all other stages.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Vanaprastha (Retired Life)</h3>
  <p>
    Once responsibilities toward family are fulfilled, a person gradually withdraws from worldly attachments.  
    In this stage, one hands over duties to the next generation and engages in meditation, study, and service.  
    This stage represents the transition from material life to spiritual focus.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Sannyasa (Renunciation)</h3>
  <p>
    The final stage is complete renunciation. A Sannyasi gives up material possessions and dedicates life to the pursuit of Moksha.  
    They wander, meditate, and spread spiritual wisdom. Examples include saints like Swami Vivekananda and Ramakrishna Paramhansa.
  </p>

  <h2>Philosophical Classifications</h2>
  <p>
    Sanātan Dharma is not only about social and life duties—it also classifies spiritual paths.  
    Every individual has a different temperament, and therefore multiple ways to approach God exist.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Bhakti Yoga (Path of Devotion)</h3>
  <p>
    For emotional and devotional people, the path of love for God is emphasized.  
    Saints like Meera Bai, Tulsidas, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu spread this way.  
    Singing bhajans, chanting mantras, and surrendering to God are central practices.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Karma Yoga (Path of Action)</h3>
  <p>
    For active individuals, the Bhagavad Gita teaches Karma Yoga—doing one’s duty selflessly without attachment to results.  
    This path harmonizes worldly life with spiritual progress.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Jnana Yoga (Path of Knowledge)</h3>
  <p>
    For intellectual seekers, Jnana Yoga emphasizes inquiry into the nature of the Self and Brahman.  
    “Who am I?” is the central question. Saints like Adi Shankaracharya highlighted this path.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Raja Yoga (Path of Meditation)</h3>
  <p>
    Raja Yoga, described by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras, emphasizes meditation, concentration, and control of the mind.  
    It is a scientific path leading to self-realization.
  </p>

  <h2>Scriptural Foundations</h2>
  <p>
    The classifications of Varna and Ashrama are described in many scriptures:  
    <ul>
      <li><b>Rigveda</b> (Purusha Sukta) describes the cosmic origin of the four varnas.</li>
      <li><b>Bhagavad Gita</b> (Chapter 4, Verse 13) says: “Chaturvarnyam maya srishtam guna karma vibhagashah” – The four varnas were created according to qualities and actions.</li>
      <li><b>Manusmriti</b> describes detailed duties of each class.</li>
      <li><b>Upanishads</b> emphasize the unity of all paths, showing that all classifications aim at liberation.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose and Misuse</h2>
  <p>
    The original purpose of classification in Sanātan Dharma was harmony, balance, and spiritual growth.  
    Unfortunately, over time, the Varna system became rigid and hereditary, leading to caste-based discrimination.  
    Saints like Kabir, Guru Nanak, and Swami Vivekananda criticized the misuse of caste, reminding people of the true spiritual essence.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Classification in Sanātan Dharma is not about division but about guidance.  
    The four Varnas, the four Ashramas, and the various Yogas all point toward one goal: the realization of the Self and harmony in society.  
    When understood in its true spirit, Sanātan Dharma’s classification is a system that integrates duty, knowledge, devotion, and spirituality 
    into a balanced life aimed at the highest liberation—Moksha.
