  <h1>Rulers Who Spread and Protected Sanatan Dharma</h1>

  <p>The survival and flourishing of Sanatan Dharma across millennia was not only due to saints and sages, but also because of kings who actively defended and spread the religion. At times when alien ideologies, heterodox sects, and foreign invasions tried to weaken the dharmic order, rulers arose with firm commitment to the traditions of the Vedas, the rituals of yajnas, and the authority of Brahmanas. These rulers followed orthodox Hindu policies and ensured that Sanatan Dharma remained the guiding light of Bharat. Among them, Pushyamitra Shunga stands out as one of the earliest champions.</p>

  <h2>Pushyamitra Shunga (2nd Century BCE)</h2>
  <p>Pushyamitra Shunga was the founder of the Shunga dynasty after he overthrew the last Mauryan ruler, Brihadratha, around 185 BCE. The Mauryan Empire under Ashoka had supported Buddhism heavily, often sidelining Vedic traditions. Pushyamitra, himself a Brahmin and general, revived orthodox Sanatan Dharma as the state religion. He is remembered as a strong supporter of Vedic rituals and sacrifices (yajnas) which had declined under the Mauryan Buddhists.</p>

  <p>One of his most significant policies was the re-establishment of <b>Ashvamedha Yajnas</b>, the grand horse sacrifice symbolizing the authority of a sovereign Hindu ruler. These yajnas were central to the Vedic order and Pushyamitra ensured their revival on a large scale. He also patronized Brahmanas, temples, and Vedic scholars, strengthening the social and cultural foundations of Hindu society. His reign is often marked as the beginning of a Hindu revival in North India.</p>

  <p>Some Buddhist chronicles accused him of persecution of Buddhists. While historians debate the extent of this, there is no doubt that his policies favored orthodox Hinduism. His rule represents the determined efforts of a king to protect and re-establish Sanatan Dharma against competing religions. For this reason, Pushyamitra Shunga is often called a <i>kattar Hindu ruler</i>, one who believed that the strength of the kingdom depended on the strength of Vedic dharma.</p>

  <h2>Shunga Dynasty After Pushyamitra</h2>
  <p>The Shunga rulers who followed Pushyamitra continued his orthodox Hindu policy. They resisted invasions from Yavanas (Indo-Greeks) and protected the sacred geography of Bharat. Temples, rituals, and Sanskrit learning flourished. The dynasty marked a clear return to Hindu orthodoxy after the Buddhist dominance under Mauryan patronage.</p>

  <h2>Kanva Dynasty (1st Century BCE)</h2>
  <p>After the Shungas, the Kanva dynasty carried forward the tradition of orthodox Hindu support. Though smaller in power, the Kanvas remained patrons of Brahmanical practices and upheld Sanatan Dharma. They too ensured that Vedic sacrifices and rituals were maintained as the foundation of their state.</p>

  <h2>Gupta Emperors (4th–6th Century CE)</h2>
  <p>Centuries later, the Gupta Empire is often described as the <b>Golden Age of Hinduism</b>. Rulers such as Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II revived the glory of Sanatan Dharma with strong patronage to Sanskrit literature, Hindu temples, and Vedic learning. Though tolerant of other faiths, they were staunch Hindus in their policies. The Guptas promoted Puranic Hinduism, built temples to Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi, and ensured that Brahmanas received grants and support.</p>
  <p>Samudragupta is even praised in inscriptions as a king who performed multiple <b>Ashvamedha Yajnas</b>, echoing the tradition of Pushyamitra. Their rule consolidated Hindu culture so deeply that even after their decline, Sanatan Dharma remained the dominant way of life across the subcontinent.</p>

  <h2>Other Orthodox Hindu Kings</h2>
  <p>Beyond these dynasties, many regional rulers contributed to the spread of Hinduism. The Pallavas in the South patronized grand temples like those in Kanchipuram. The Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas continued temple-building traditions. In every age, rulers understood that the protection of dharma was the highest duty of the king, as prescribed in the Manusmriti and Arthashastra.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The story of Sanatan Dharma is not just of philosophy and spirituality, but also of power and politics. Kings like Pushyamitra Shunga were determined defenders of orthodoxy, ensuring that Vedic yajnas, rituals, and the role of Brahmanas continued without interruption. Their policies sometimes appear rigid, but they were essential for preserving the foundation of Hindu society in times when it was under challenge. Along with the Guptas and others, they laid the groundwork for the long survival of Hindu civilization. Truly, these rulers were the protectors and spreaders of Sanatan Dharma.</p>
