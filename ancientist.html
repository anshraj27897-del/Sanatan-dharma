  <h1>Sanatan Dharma – The Ancientist Religion</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Sanatan Dharma</strong>, often referred to as Hinduism in modern times, is considered the world’s oldest living religion. 
    The word “Sanatan” means eternal, timeless, and beyond destruction, while “Dharma” means the eternal law, duty, righteousness, and cosmic order. 
    Unlike other organized religions with a known founder, Sanatan Dharma has no single originator. 
    It has evolved naturally from the earliest human civilizations on the Indian subcontinent and has been passed down orally and scripturally for thousands of years.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Antiquity of Sanatan Dharma</h2>
  <p>
    Archaeological evidence from the <strong>Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3000–1500 BCE)</strong> shows practices that resonate with later Hindu traditions: 
    worship of mother goddesses, proto-Shiva figures in yogic postures, sacred symbols like the swastika, and water-based purification rituals. 
    Scholars believe that these early cultural practices blended with Vedic traditions brought by Indo-Aryans to form the roots of Sanatan Dharma.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Rigveda</strong>, the oldest surviving scripture in the world (c. 1500–1200 BCE), provides hymns to natural deities such as Agni (fire), Indra (thunder), Varuna (cosmic order), and Surya (sun). 
    These hymns emphasize cosmic law, moral duties, and ritual sacrifices – forming the foundation of Sanatan Dharma.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Philosophical Depth</h2>
  <p>
    Sanatan Dharma is not just a religion but also a <strong>complete philosophical system</strong>. 
    It produced the six classical schools of philosophy known as the <em>Shad Darshanas</em>: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nyaya</strong> – logic and reasoning</li>
      <li><strong>Vaisheshika</strong> – metaphysics and atomism</li>
      <li><strong>Samkhya</strong> – dualism of Purusha (spirit) and Prakriti (matter)</li>
      <li><strong>Yoga</strong> – discipline of mind and body</li>
      <li><strong>Mimamsa</strong> – ritualism and dharma</li>
      <li><strong>Vedanta</strong> – the culmination of Vedic thought, focusing on Brahman (the ultimate reality)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    These philosophies were not meant to oppose each other but to provide diverse paths to truth. 
    At their core, they affirm the existence of <strong>Dharma</strong>, <strong>Karma</strong>, <strong>Reincarnation</strong>, and <strong>Moksha</strong> (liberation).
  </p>

  <h2>3. Eternal Principles</h2>
  <p>
    Sanatan Dharma is called “eternal” because it is based on truths that are believed to exist independently of time, space, or culture. 
    These eternal principles include:
    <ul>
      <li>The cyclical nature of time – creation, preservation, and dissolution (Srishti, Sthiti, Pralaya).</li>
      <li>The moral law of <strong>Karma</strong> – actions and their inevitable consequences.</li>
      <li>The journey of the <strong>Atman</strong> (soul) through countless births until liberation.</li>
      <li>The unity of all beings as manifestations of the one ultimate reality, <strong>Brahman</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>4. Protectors and Propagators</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout history, Sanatan Dharma faced challenges but was preserved by sages, saints, and kings:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sages (Rishis)</strong> like Vyasa, Valmiki, and Patanjali compiled scriptures, epics, and yoga sutras to preserve eternal knowledge.</li>
      <li><strong>Kings and rulers</strong> like Chandragupta Maurya, Pushyamitra Shunga, and the Guptas patronized Hindu institutions, temples, and Vedic rituals.</li>
      <li><strong>Bhakti Saints</strong> like Mirabai, Tulsidas, Kabir, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu spread devotion among the masses.</li>
      <li><strong>Modern leaders</strong> like Swami Vivekananda, Aurobindo, and Dayananda Saraswati reawakened Hindu pride during colonial times.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>5. Sanatan Dharma’s Influence on World Civilization</h2>
  <p>
    The universal ideas of Sanatan Dharma have influenced not just India but the entire world:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Yoga</strong> and <strong>Meditation</strong> are now practiced globally for peace of mind and physical health.</li>
      <li>Concepts like <strong>Ahimsa</strong> (non-violence) inspired figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and even Martin Luther King Jr.</li>
      <li>Mathematical and astronomical knowledge from ancient Hindu texts enriched human civilization.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>6. Why Sanatan Dharma is “Ancientist”</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike religions that began with prophets or founders, Sanatan Dharma has no beginning and no end. 
    It is “ancientist” because:
    <ul>
      <li>It traces back to prehistoric civilizations like Harappa and Vedic culture.</li>
      <li>It survived invasions, foreign rule, and cultural changes while retaining its identity.</li>
      <li>It adapts to time and place, yet remains rooted in eternal truths.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Sanatan Dharma is more than a religion – it is a way of life, a philosophy, and a civilization. 
    Its strength lies in its flexibility and eternal principles that guide humanity towards truth, righteousness, and liberation. 
    This is why it is regarded as the <strong>world’s oldest and eternal Dharma – the Sanatan Dharma</strong>.
