  <h1>Hindu Rulers and Their Orthodox Policies</h1>

  <p>
    Throughout Indian history, several Hindu rulers played an important role in protecting and reviving Sanātan Dharma.  
    They saw themselves not only as kings but also as <b>guardians of Dharma</b>. Their policies reflected a commitment to 
    uphold Vedic traditions, patronize Brahmins, build temples, and preserve orthodox Hindu practices.  
    Among them, Pushyamitra Shunga stands out as one of the most prominent rulers who openly followed a strong orthodox Hindu policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Pushyamitra Shunga</h2>
  <p>
    Pushyamitra Shunga (ruled c. 185–149 BCE) was the founder of the Shunga dynasty. He was originally a general under the Mauryan king 
    Brihadratha. According to historical records, he assassinated Brihadratha during a military parade and declared himself king.  
    His rise marked a major political and religious shift in ancient India.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Promotion of Vedic Religion</h3>
  <p>
    Pushyamitra was a staunch follower of Brahmanism. Unlike the later Mauryas, especially Ashoka, who supported Buddhism, 
    Pushyamitra revived Vedic rituals. He is said to have performed two <b>Ashvamedha Yajnas</b> (horse sacrifices), which were 
    ancient royal rituals symbolizing power and sovereignty.  
    These yajnas reinforced the authority of Brahmins and the supremacy of Vedic traditions.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Orthodox Hindu Policy</h3>
  <p>
    His reign is often remembered for its <b>orthodox Hindu policies</b>. He gave land grants to Brahmins, 
    patronized Sanskrit learning, and supported temples dedicated to Hindu deities.  
    Some Buddhist texts accuse him of persecuting Buddhists, though historians debate this.  
    What is clear, however, is that Pushyamitra strongly promoted the dominance of Hindu orthodoxy.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Impact on Society</h3>
  <p>
    Pushyamitra’s policies strengthened the Brahminical order. The Varna system was reinforced, and Brahmins gained political influence.  
    By supporting Vedic rituals, he re-established Hindu traditions that had declined under Buddhist influence during Ashoka’s time.  
    This revival had a long-lasting effect, shaping the future of Indian religion and culture.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Hindu Rulers and Orthodox Policies</h2>

  <h3>1. Samudragupta (335–375 CE)</h3>
  <p>
    Known as the “Napoleon of India,” Samudragupta of the Gupta dynasty was a great conqueror.  
    He was also a devoted supporter of Hinduism, performing Vedic sacrifices and encouraging Sanskrit literature.  
    His rule strengthened orthodox practices, while also being tolerant of other religions.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Chandragupta II (Vikramaditya)</h3>
  <p>
    Another Gupta emperor, Chandragupta II, promoted Vaishnavism and built many temples dedicated to Vishnu.  
    He patronized scholars like Kalidasa, whose works reflect Hindu philosophical and cultural values.  
    His reign is often remembered as a golden age of Sanātan Dharma.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Harshavardhana (606–647 CE)</h3>
  <p>
    Though Harsha initially supported Buddhism, later sources show that he leaned towards Shaivism (worship of Shiva).  
    He sponsored grand assemblies where Brahmins were honored, showing the continuing importance of orthodox Hindu policies.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Later Rajput Rulers</h3>
  <p>
    Rajput kings such as Prithviraj Chauhan, though primarily warriors, also upheld Hindu traditions.  
    They built temples, supported Brahmins, and saw themselves as defenders of Sanātan Dharma against foreign invasions.  
    Their kingdoms became centers of Hindu culture and orthodox practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Nature of Orthodox Hindu Policy</h2>
  <p>
    The term <b>orthodox Hindu policy</b> generally refers to:  
    <ul>
      <li>Patronage of Brahmins and scholars.</li>
      <li>Performance of Vedic rituals and sacrifices.</li>
      <li>Promotion of Sanskrit as the language of religion and culture.</li>
      <li>Construction of temples and preservation of Hindu art.</li>
      <li>Reinforcement of the Varna system and dharmashastras (law codes).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <p>
    The policies of Pushyamitra and other Hindu rulers had a long-lasting legacy.  
    They ensured the survival and strengthening of Hindu traditions at times when alternative religions like Buddhism and Jainism 
    were influential. While sometimes criticized as rigid or intolerant, these rulers also preserved India’s spiritual and cultural roots.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Pushyamitra Shunga and many rulers after him acted as protectors of Sanātan Dharma.  
    Their orthodox Hindu policies helped preserve Vedic traditions, Brahmanical rituals, and the authority of Hindu scriptures.  
    Though interpretations vary, their reigns mark important chapters in the history of Hindu civilization.
