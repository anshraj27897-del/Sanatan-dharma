  <h1>Great Hindu Rulers - Protectors of Sanatan Dharma</h1>

  <p>
    Bharatvarsha has seen many kings and dynasties rise and fall. Among them, some rulers were remembered 
    not merely for political conquests but for their unyielding commitment to <b>Sanatan Dharma</b>. 
    These orthodox rulers — Brahmanical kings, Rajput warriors, and dharmic protectors — stood firm in 
    reviving Vedic sacrifices, protecting temples, resisting invaders, and safeguarding Hindu society. 
    Their legacy shines as an eternal flame of dharma.
  </p>

  <h2>Pushyamitra Shunga (185–149 BCE)</h2>
  <p>
    Pushyamitra Shunga, the general who overthrew the last Maurya king Brihadratha, founded the 
    <b>Shunga dynasty</b>. Unlike the Mauryas, who supported Buddhism heavily, Pushyamitra reasserted 
    the power of <b>Brahmanism</b>. He performed grand <i>Vedic yajnas</i> like the 
    <i>Ashvamedha</i> and <i>Rajasuya</i>, showing that Vedic culture was alive and thriving.
  </p>
  <p>
    Buddhist texts accuse him of persecuting monks and destroying stupas, while Hindu records glorify 
    him as a <b>restorer of Sanatan traditions</b>. Whatever the exaggeration, one fact is certain: 
    he tilted the balance back in favor of orthodox Hindu faith, reaffirming Brahmanical rituals 
    and temple building across North India.
  </p>

  <h2>Prithviraj Chauhan (1149–1192 CE)</h2>
  <p>
    Known as <i>Rai Pithora</i>, Prithviraj Chauhan ruled Ajmer and Delhi during the last phase of 
    Hindu sovereignty in North India. A brave warrior, he fought multiple wars with Muhammad Ghori. 
    In the <b>First Battle of Tarain (1191)</b>, he defeated the Ghurid forces decisively, 
    but the <b>Second Battle of Tarain (1192)</b> ended in his tragic defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the loss, Prithviraj is remembered as a <b>kshatriya protector of Sanatan Dharma</b>. 
    His court patronized Sanskrit learning, rituals, and temple culture. His courage became symbolic 
    of Hindu resistance, and his memory has inspired Sanatani warriors for centuries.
  </p>

  <h2>Hammir Dev Chauhan (13th–14th Century)</h2>
  <p>
    Hammir Dev, the Chauhan ruler of Ranthambore, is often seen as the last great defender of Chauhan 
    pride against the Delhi Sultans. A <b>fierce upholder of dharma</b>, Hammir saw his duty as 
    protecting temples, Brahmins, and Hindu honor. His battles with Alauddin Khilji are remembered 
    as heroic stands for Sanatan pride.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hammir emphasized the performance of yajnas, donations to Brahmins, and resisted foreign taxation 
    imposed on Hindus. His life was dedicated to defending the <b>dharmic order</b> even against 
    impossible odds.
  </p>

  <h2>Rao Chandrasen Rathore (1544–1581 CE)</h2>
  <p>
    Rao Chandrasen, son of Rao Maldeo of Marwar, is remembered as one of the few Rajputs who 
    <b>never submitted to Akbar</b>. Unlike other Rajput houses that allied with the Mughals, 
    Chandrasen considered alliance with foreign rulers as a betrayal of Sanatan Dharma.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though his kingdom was small, his spirit was unbreakable. From the deserts of Marwar he 
    continued guerrilla warfare, protecting temples and resisting Mughal influence. His reign, 
    though short, became a symbol of <b>unyielding loyalty to Hindu dharma</b>.
  </p>

  <h2>Suheldev of Shravasti (11th Century)</h2>
  <p>
    Maharaja Suheldev, a Hindu king from Shravasti (present-day Uttar Pradesh), is celebrated 
    for defeating the Ghaznavid general Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud. Suheldev united Hindu warriors 
    from different communities — Rajputs, Bhars, Kurmis — and crushed the invaders near Bahraich.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is remembered not only as a military hero but as a <b>protector of Sanatan Dharma</b>. 
    His resistance prevented further Ghaznavid expansion into the heart of the Ganga plains. 
    Folk ballads still sing of his dedication to dharma and the unity of Hindus under his command.
  </p>

  <h2>Kanhad Dev Chauhan (Early 14th Century)</h2>
  <p>
    Kanhad Dev, the ruler of Jalore (Rajasthan), became famous for his resistance to Alauddin Khilji. 
    When Alauddin captured Gujarat and took away the Somnath temple idol, Kanhad Dev ambushed the 
    army and recovered the idol. This brave act made him immortal in the hearts of Hindus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kanhad Dev’s court was deeply Sanatani — Brahmins were protected, temples were patronized, 
    and Hindu rituals thrived. His sacrifice against Khilji is regarded as a <b>martyrdom for dharma</b>.
  </p>

  <h2>Guhilot Sisodia Rajputs of Mewar</h2>
  <p>
    Long before Maharana Pratap, the Guhilot (Sisodia) Rajputs of Mewar had been fierce protectors 
    of Sanatan Dharma. They resisted Islamic invaders from the 11th century onward, often facing 
    destruction but never abandoning their duty to dharma. 
  </p>
  <p>
    They maintained the <b>orthodox Rajput code</b> — yajnas, protection of cows, and building temples. 
    Their sacrifices created a tradition that culminated later in the valor of Maharana Pratap.
  </p>

  <h2>Legacy of Orthodox Sanatani Rulers</h2>
  <p>
    These rulers — Pushyamitra Shunga, Prithviraj Chauhan, Hammir Dev, Rao Chandrasen, Suheldev, 
    Kanhad Dev, and the Guhilot Rajputs — are remembered not only as kings but as <b>guardians of dharma</b>. 
    They stood firmly for Sanatan values, protecting Brahmins, temples, and the Vedic way of life. 
    Their sacrifices ensured that the flame of Sanatan Dharma could never be extinguished.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their stories remind us that Sanatan Dharma survives not only through philosophy and rituals 
    but through the courage of those who defend it at the cost of their lives. They were not 
    merely rulers — they were <b>kattar dharmic warriors</b>, eternal shields of Bharat’s soul.
