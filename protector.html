  <h1>Protector Organisations of Sanatan Dharma in Modern Times</h1>

  <p>Sanatan Dharma has survived thousands of years through invasions, colonialism, and cultural attacks. While in the past kings and rulers protected dharma, in modern times various organisations have taken up this responsibility. These organisations stand firm in defense of Hindu traditions, values, and culture, ensuring that Sanatan Dharma continues to guide society. Among them, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajrang Dal, and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) play crucial roles.</p>

  <h2>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)</h2>
  <p>Founded in 1925 by Dr. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is one of the largest voluntary organizations in the world. Its primary goal is to organize Hindu society and awaken pride in Sanatan Dharma. Every morning, lakhs of swayamsevaks (volunteers) gather in shakhas (daily assemblies) where they practice physical training, discipline, and cultural education.</p>
  <p>The RSS promotes values such as selfless service, unity, and cultural pride. During national emergencies such as wars, natural disasters, and social unrest, RSS volunteers have always come forward to provide relief. Beyond service, its ideological commitment has been to protect Hindu dharma from conversion, distortion, and neglect. It emphasizes the vision of a strong, united Bharat based on dharmic principles.</p>

  <h2>Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP)</h2>
  <p>The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established in 1964 with the aim of protecting and spreading Hindu dharma across the globe. Its mission is to unite Hindus worldwide, protect temples, and counter activities that threaten the survival of Hindu culture. VHP has been active in movements to reclaim sacred sites, promote religious education, and resist conversions by other religions.</p>
  <p>One of the most visible roles of VHP has been its leadership in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, which ultimately led to the construction of the grand Shri Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The VHP sees itself as the protector of Hindu sacred spaces and works with saints, religious leaders, and local communities to ensure Sanatan Dharma thrives in every corner of Bharat and abroad.</p>

  <h2>Bajrang Dal</h2>
  <p>Bajrang Dal, the youth wing of the VHP, was founded in 1984. Dedicated to Lord Hanuman, the Bajrang Dal plays a direct and active role in protecting Hindu society, especially the youth. Its members work on the ground to resist conversions, protect cows (gau raksha), and defend temples. They are also known for their campaigns against forces they see as threats to dharma, whether cultural or religious.</p>
  <p>Although sometimes portrayed as aggressive, Bajrang Dal considers itself as the shield of Hindu dharma in modern times. For young Hindus, it provides a platform to channel their energy towards service, discipline, and defense of their heritage.</p>

  <h2>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</h2>
  <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party, the largest political party in India today, was established in 1980 as the political arm of a larger ideological family inspired by Sanatan Dharma. While it functions as a political party within democratic frameworks, its connection to Hindu cultural identity is strong. Leaders of BJP have emphasized cultural nationalism, respect for ancient traditions, and the need to protect India’s dharmic identity.</p>
  <p>Through its governance, the BJP has worked to restore pride in India’s ancient civilization, whether by rebuilding temples, supporting traditional practices, or reviving yoga and Ayurveda globally. Its policies often reflect the vision of a Bharat rooted in Sanatan values, while also engaging in modern development and governance.</p>

  <h2>Other Dharmic Organisations</h2>
  <p>Beyond these, numerous other groups, saints, and trusts protect Sanatan Dharma today. Organisations like Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, ISKCON, and countless temple trusts contribute to spreading the eternal philosophy. Together, they ensure that Hindu culture not only survives but flourishes in a modern world facing rapid globalization and cultural shifts.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In ancient times, kings like Maharana Pratap and Shivaji protected Sanatan Dharma with sword and shield. In modern times, organisations like RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, and BJP carry the same mission forward in their own ways—through social work, temple movements, political leadership, and cultural revival. Sanatan Dharma is eternal, but it survives only when its protectors are vigilant. These organisations represent that eternal flame of vigilance and commitment, ensuring that Hindu society remains strong, united, and dharmic.</p>
